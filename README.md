# Simon Game

## Description

The Simon Game web app is a single player game where a player tries to remember the order in which buttons have lit up and press those buttons in that same order. If the player completes the pattern successfully, they go to the next level where an additional light-up is added to the sequence. If the player chooses incorrectly, the game ends and they can start a new pattern on the same level. The player can also reset the game, set the level to one that they have already beaten, and choose how many buttons are used in the game.

## User Story

-   As a user I want to be able to select the number of buttons used in the game.
-   As a user I want to press a `Start Next Sequence` button to begin the next pattern to replicate.
-   As a user I want to see the buttons highlight to in the order in which they should be pushed.
-   As a user I want to be able to click on the buttons to attempt to replicate the pattern.
-   As a user I want to hear a tone associated to each button when the pattern is displaying and when I click the button.
-   As a user I want the game to display when I have completed the pattern or click an incorrect button.
-   As a user I want the difficulty level to increase by one when I have completed a pattern.
-   As a user I want to be able to select the level that I am playing based on levels that I have beaten.
-   As a user I want to be able to press a `New Game` button to reset the level back to 1.
-   As a user I want my game state to be saved in local storage between reloads.
